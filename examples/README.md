## Example Uses of ParticleGrid
---
We provide some examples of ParticleGrid in action

1. [Visualization](visualization/): 3D visualizations of grids generated with ParticleGrid using [k3d](https://k3d-jupyter.org/)
2. [PCQM4M-3D](PCQM4M-3D/) Using ParticleGrid and 3D coorinates of molecules to predictmolecular DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gaps on the [OGB-LSC-PCQM4M](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/pcqm4mv2/) dataset
