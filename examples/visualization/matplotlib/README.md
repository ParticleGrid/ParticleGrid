# Visualization using Matplotlib

## Installation instructions 

The provided example uses the GUI backend to display the molecule. We use `PyQt5` for the matplotlib backed. 

Install the working example dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Other GUI backends, such as `Qt5Agg`, `GTKAgg`, `Qt4Agg` can be used in theory, but have not been tested.
